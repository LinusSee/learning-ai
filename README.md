# TODO
Here I list the things I intend or am considering to do
1. Improve the mnist example by reading the book http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/
2. Implement an evolutionary algorithm, that learns to e.g. move
3. Test the digit recognition with own examples
4. Implement k-nearest neighbours
5. Implement linear classifier
