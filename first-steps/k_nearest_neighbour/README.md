# K-nearest neighbour
# Goals
KNN is a popular machine learning algorithm and (as far as I know at the time of this writing) a good classifier for linearly solvable,
low dimensional problems.

Also it is great to consolidate several of the foundations for machine learning and I get to experiment a bit more with python and
libraries that will also be needed in more complex examples.
