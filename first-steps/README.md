# Purpose of this folder
Every subfolder of the "first-steps" folder is it's own project. Here lie all the projects I already wrote or am currently writing to learn the basics of machine learning and neural networks.
# Project order
Since earlier projects are easier to understand than the more advanced later projects, here a list of the projects ordered from earliest to the latest.
1. Simple perceptron
2. Xor-Gate
3. General purpose neural network
