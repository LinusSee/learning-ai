# General purpose network
The goal of this project is to implement a neural network that is not hardcoded to a certain amount of neurons per layer. It will be configurable on creation and math stuff like matrix multiplication will be done by libraries, to 
keep the code clean from all logic that doesn't belong to the network.
<br>
To test the network I will implement a UI, where a user can create a neural network, give it its training inputs and view the results. The UI will probably fairly simple and therefore only allow testing of logic gates.
<br>
When finished, the network should be able to feed forward and train no matter how many layers and neurons have been chosen.
