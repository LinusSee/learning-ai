# Simple Perceptron
In this project I wrote a simple perceptron, which classifies points by whether they lie above or below a line. For this the perceptron revieves two inputs and evaluates them to a single output, which is either a 1 or a -1 depending whether the point lies above or below the line.
<br>
Since this is about AI and neural networks the perceptron also has a training function with a (albeit primitive) gradient descent algorithm.
<br>
<br>
To visualize this and to be able to run it on pretty much every machine, I wrote this project in javascript. All points are drawn onto a canvas colorcoded with red incorrectly and green for correctly classified points. Training iterations have to be manually triggered to allow the user to better follow the process of learning.

The project can be displayed by opening the index.html in a browser.

**NOTE:** Since this project used the HTML5-element "canvas" the browser must support HTML5
